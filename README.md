# Boids
Simulate complex and coordinated collision avoidance

# Background:
Boids are computer generated motion of animals such as flocks of birds or schools of fish.
There are three main rules to the movement pattern of boids.

1. Separation
    - Avoid crowding with fellow boids.
2. Alignment
    - Move in a similar direction as other boids.
3. Cohesion
    - Move to the average position of fellow boids.
